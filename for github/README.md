## Project Overview

The 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal resulted in varied levels of damage to buildings, influenced by their structural and geographic characteristics. Traditional assessment methods based on manual inspection are slow, resource-intensive, and prone to human bias. Although prior studies have primarily focused on structural simulations and post-disaster surveys, few have explored scalable predictive models. This project addresses that gap by applying machine learning to automate the classification of buildings into three ordinal damage grades: low, medium, and high.

We used a publicly available dataset compiled by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, featuring 38 structural and locational attributes per building. Preprocessing steps included checking for missing values, applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables, standardizing numerical features, applying SMOTE to address class imbalance, and using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Multiple models were evaluated, including Random Forest, Neural Networks, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, with XGBoost performing best due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and model complex nonlinear relationships. Neural networks were also trained using a range of hyperparameter combinations.

Model performance was evaluated using the micro-averaged F1 score to reflect class imbalance and the ordinal nature of the problem. Our best model achieved a micro F1 score of **0.7355**, demonstrating the potential for accurate, consistent, and scalable post-earthquake damage prediction.
